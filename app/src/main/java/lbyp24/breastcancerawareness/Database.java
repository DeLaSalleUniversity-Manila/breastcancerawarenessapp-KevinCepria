                "Chemotherapy treatment uses medicine to weaken and destroy cancer cells in the body, including cells at the original cancer site and any cancer cells that may have spread to another part of the body. ",
                "Hormone therapy is another form of systemic therapy. It is most often used as an adjuvant therapy to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back after surgery, but it can be used as neoadjuvant treatment, as well. It is also used to treat cancer that has come back after treatment or has spread.",
                "A highly targeted and highly effective way to destroy cancer cells in the breast that may stick around after surgery. Radiation can reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence by about 70%. Despite what many people fear, radiation therapy is relatively easy to tolerate and its side effects are limited to the treated area.",
                "Most women with breast cancer have some type of surgery. Surgery is often needed to remove a breast tumour. Options for this include breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy. The breast can be reconstructed at the same time as surgery or later on. Surgery is also used to check the lymph nodes under the arm for cancer spread",
                "Treatment that targets specific characteristics of cancer cells, such as a protein that allows the cancer cells to grow in a rapid or abnormal way. Targeted therapies are generally less likely than chemotherapy to harm normal, healthy cells. Some targeted therapies are antibodies that work like the antibodies made naturally by our immune systems."};

    String DiagnosisDescription[]={"A biopsy is a small operation done to remove tissue from an area of concern in the body. The tissue sample is examined by a pathologist  to see whether or not cancer cells are present. If cancer is present, the pathologist can then look at the cancer’s characteristics. The biopsy will result in a report that lays out all of the pathologist’s findings.",
            "These tests check to see whether the blood has normal amounts of various types of blood cells. The cancer itself and treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy can reduce the levels of important blood cells your body needs to function properly.",
            "Blood chemistry tests measure levels of certain substances in the blood that can tell your doctor whether or not some organs are healthy and functioning properly during treatment. Abnormal blood chemistry results also may suggest that the breast cancer has spread to the bone or liver. In this case, your doctor would order an imaging study, such as a bone scan or CT scan, to gather more information.",
            "A bone scan, also called bone scintigraphy, is an imaging test used to determine whether breast cancer has travelled to the bones.",
            "MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a technology that uses magnets and radio waves to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the inside of the body. MRI does not use X-rays, so it does not involve any radiation exposure.",
            "A breast physical exam is a careful manual examination of the breasts by a doctor or other health professional. This exam can help find lumps that women may miss with their own self-exams.",
            "Regularly examining your breasts on your own, can be an important way to find a breast cancer early, when it's more likely to be treated successfully. Not every cancer can be found this way, but it is a critical step you can and should take for yourself.",
            "An X-ray technique that gives doctors information about the body’s internal organs in 2-dimensional slices, or cross-sections. During a CT scan, you lie on a moving table and pass through a doughnut-shaped machine that takes X-rays of the body from many different angles.",
            "Chest X-ray are used to check and see whether the cancer has spread to the lungs. The test also may be used to assess the heart and lungs before you receive general anaesthesia or chemotherapy.",
            "Digital tomosynthesis creates a 3-dimensional picture of the breast using X-rays. Digital tomosynthesis of the breast is different from a standard mammogram in the same way a CT scan of the chest is different from a standard chest X-ray. Or think of the difference between a ball and a circle. One is 3-dimensional, the other is flat.",
            "A genomic test that analyses the activity of certain genes in early-stage breast cancer.",
            "Diagnostic mammography is similar to screening mammography except that more pictures of the breast are taken, and it is often used when a woman is experiencing signs, such as a new lump or nipple discharge. Diagnostic mammography may also be used if something suspicious is found on a screening mammogram.",
            "The Mammostrat test, made by Clarient Diagnostic Services, is a genomic test that measures the levels of five certain genes in early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer cells.",
            "The MarginProbe System uses electromagnetic waves to identify possibly cancerous tissue. It was developed to help surgeons better judge how much tissue needs to be removed during lumpectomy, making it less likely that a woman will need more surgery after lumpectomy.",
            "Uses a radioactive tracer that “lights up” any areas of cancer inside the breast. This tracer is injected into the body through a vein in the arm. Breast cancer cells tend to take up the radioactive substance much more than normal cells do. A special camera called a nuclear medicine scanner then scans the breast, looking for any areas where the radioactive substance is concentrated.",
            "The Oncotype DX test is a genomic test that analyses the activity of a group of genes that can affect how a cancer is likely to behave and respond to treatment. ",
            "Can detect areas of cancer by obtaining dynamic images of the body’s cells. First, you are injected with a substance made up of sugar and a small amount of radioactive material. Cancer cells tend to be more active than normal cells, and they absorb more of the radioactive sugar as a result. A special camera then scans the body to pick up any “highlighted” areas on a computer screen. This helps radiologists identify areas where cells are suspiciously active, which can indicate cancer.",
            "Thermography, also called thermal imaging, uses a special camera to measure the temperature of the skin on the breast’s surface. It is non-invasive test that involves no radiation.",
            "Ultrasound is an imaging test that sends high-frequency sound waves through your breast and converts them into images on a viewing screen. There is no radiation involved.",

       String AdvanceTreatmentDescrption [] = {"Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) can often be used for early-stage breast cancers. But in some women, it can result in breasts of different sizes and/or shapes. For larger tumors, it might not even be possible, and a mastectomy might be needed instead. Some doctors address this problem by combining cancer surgery and plastic surgery techniques, known as oncoplastic surgery. This typically involves reshaping the breast at the time of the initial surgery, and may mean operating on the other breast as well to make them more symmetrical. This approach is still fairly new, and not all doctors are comfortable with it."
                ,"A drug class has been developed that targets cancers caused by BRCA mutations. This class of drugs is called PARP inhibitors and they have shown promise in clinical trials treating breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers that had spread and were resistant to other treatments. Further studies are being done to see if this drug can help patients without BRCA mutations.", ""};
